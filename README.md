# plotly-interactive-map-with-R-1
A data visualization project with R and plotly for minimum wages in US states from 1968 - 2017

This project is to demonstrate that we can create map charts with interactive pop-up labels and time line with plotly in R. The project is a modified version of the tutorial from this following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrtqBYLf404&t=59s.

The wage data used in the project was obtained from Kaggle.com via: https://www.kaggle.com/lislejoem/us-minimum-wage-by-state-from-1968-to-2017
The state code abbrivations information was obtained from: https://worldpopulationreview.com/states/state-abbreviations

This project can be extended to visualizing any time-dependent geographical information from any country in the world, provided that the location and scope information is available to plotly.
